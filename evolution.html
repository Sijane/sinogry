                    <h3>Ancient China</h3>
                        <p>
                            The contemporary Chinese characters set principles were clearly visible in ancient China's <i>Jiǎgǔwén (甲骨文, Oracle bone script)</i> characters carved on ox scapulas and tortoise plastrons around 14th - 11th century BCE (Lu &amp Aiken 2004). Brush-written examples decay over time and have not survived. During the divination ceremony, after the cracks were made, characters were written with a brush on the shell or bone to be later carved.(Keightley, 1978). With the development of <i>Jīnwén (金文, Bronzeware script)</i> and <i>Dàzhuàn (大篆, Large Seal Script)</i> "cursive" signs continued. Moreover, each archaic kingdom of current China had its own set of characters.

                    <h3>Imperial China</h3>
                        <p>
                            In Imperial China, the graphs on old steles — some dating from 200 BCE, and in <i>Xiǎozhuàn (小篆, Small Seal Script)</i> style — are still accessible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In about 220 BCE, the emperor <i>Qin Shi Huang (秦始皇)</i>, the first to conquer the entire Chinese basin, imposed several reforms, among them <i>Li Si (李斯)</i>'s character unification, which created a set of 3300 standardized <i>Xiǎozhuàn (小篆)</i> characters. Despite the fact that the main writing implement of the time was already the brush, little paper survives from this period, and the main examples of this style are on steles.

                            The <i>Lìshū (隸書, Clerical Script)</i> style which is more regularized, and in some ways similar to modern text, were also authorised under <i>Qin Shi Huang (秦始皇)</i>.
                        </p>

                            <i>Kǎishū style (楷書, Traditional Regular Script)</i> — still in use today — and attributed to <i>Wang Xizhi (王羲之, 303-361)</i> and his followers, is even more regularized. Its spread was encouraged by <i>Emperor Mingzong</i> of <i>Later Tang (晚唐, 926-933)</i>, who ordered the printing of the classics using new wooden blocks in <i>Kǎishū (楷書)</i> style. Printing technologies here allowed shapes to stabilize. The <i>Kǎishū (楷書)</i> shape of characters 1000 years ago was mostly similar to that at the end of Imperial China. But small changes have been made, for example in the shape of 广 which is not absolutely the same in <i>the Kangxi Dictionary (康熙字典)</i> of 1716 as in modern books. The <i>Kangxi</i> and current shapes have tiny differences, while stroke order is still the same, according to old style.

                            Styles which did not survive include <i>Bāfēnshū (八分書)</i>, a mix of 80% <i>Xiǎozhuàn (小篆)</i> style and 20% <i>Lìshū (隸書)</i>. Some Variant Chinese characters were unorthodox or locally used for centuries. They were generally understood but always rejected in official texts. Some of these unorthodox variants, in addition to some newly created characters, were incorporated in the <i>Simplified Chinese</i> character set.                                                                                           
                    <h3>Cursive styles and hand-written styles</h3>
                        <p>
                            Cursive styles such as <i>Xíngshū (行書, semi-cursive or running script)</i> and <i>Cǎoshū (草書, cursive or grass script)</i> are less constrained and faster, where more movements made by the writing implement are visible. These styles' stroke orders vary more, sometimes creating radically different forms. They are descended from <i>Lìshū (隸書, Clerical Script)</i>, in the same time as Regular script in Han Dynasty (漢朝, 206 BCE – 220 CE)</i>, but <i>Xíngshū (行書)</i> and <i>Cǎoshū (草書)</i> were used for personal notes only, and were never used as standard. <i>Cǎoshū (草書)</i> style was highly appreciated during the reign of <i>Emperor Wu of Han (漢武帝, 140 BCE − 87 CE)</i>.

                    <h3>Printed and computer styles</h3>
                        <p>
                                Examples of modern printed styles are <i>Song (宋體)</i> from the <i>Song Dynasty (宋朝)</i>'s printing press, and <i>sans-serif</i>. These are not considered traditional styles, and are normally not written.
