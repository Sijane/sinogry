              Chinese calligraphy is a form of calligraphy widely practiced since <i>Imperial China</i> and revered in the Chinese cultural sphere, which often includes the mainland China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, etc. The calligraphic tradition of East Asia originated and developed from Imperial China. There is a general standardization of the various styles of calligraphy in this tradition. 
            </p>
            <p>
              It and ink and wash painting are closely related, since they are accomplished using similar tools and techniques. Chinese painting and calligraphy distinguish themselves from other cultural arts because they emphasize motion and are charged with dynamic life. Calligraphy has also led to the development of many forms of art, including seal carving, ornate paperweights, and inkstones.

              As a discipline calligraphy is, at the basic level, a pursuit focused on writing well. Students aim to obtain the writing characteristics of exemplary pieces of writing. Elementary school students practice calligraphy in this way, as do elders practicing temporary calligraphy, without aspiring to artistic creation.

              The contemporary Chinese characters set principles were clearly visible in ancient China's <i>Jiǎgǔwén (甲骨文, Oracle bone script)</i> characters carved on ox scapulas and tortoise plastrons around 14th - 11th century BCE (Lu &amp;amp Aiken 2004).

With the development of <i>Jīnwén (金文, Bronzeware script)</i> and <i>Dàzhuàn (大篆, Large Seal Script)</i> "cursive" signs continued.

              In Imperial China, the graphs on old steles — some dating from 200 BCE, and in <i>Xiǎozhuàn (小篆, Small Seal Script)</i> style — are still accessible.

            <p>
              In about 220 BCE, the emperor <i>Qin Shi Huang (秦始皇)</i>, the first to conquer the entire Chinese basin, imposed several reforms, among them <i>Li Si (李斯)</i>'s character unification, which created a set of 3300 standardized <i>Xiǎozhuàn (小篆)</i> characters. Despite the fact that the main writing implement of the time was already the brush, little paper survives from this period, and the main examples of this style are on steles.

            <p>
              The <i>Lìshū (隸書, Clerical Script)</i> style which is more regularized, and in some ways similar to modern text, were also authorised under <i>Qin Shi Huang (秦始皇)</i>.

              <i>Kǎishū style (楷書, Traditional Regular Script)</i> — still in use today — and attributed to <i>Wang Xizhi (王羲之, 303-361)</i> and his followers, is even more regularized. Its spread was encouraged by <i>Emperor Mingzong</i> of <i>Later Tang (晚唐, 926-933)</i>, who ordered the printing of the classics using new wooden blocks in <i>Kǎishū (楷書)</i> style. Printing technologies here allowed shapes to stabilize. The <i>Kǎishū (楷書)</i> shape of characters 1000 years ago was mostly similar to that at the end of Imperial China. But small changes have been made, for example in the shape of 广 which is not absolutely the same in <i>the Kangxi Dictionary (康熙字典)</i> of 1716 as in modern books. The <i>Kangxi</i> and current shapes have tiny differences, while stroke order is still the same, according to old style.

Some Variant Chinese characters were unorthodox or locally used for centuries. They were generally understood but always rejected in official texts. Some of these unorthodox variants, in addition to some newly created characters, were incorporated in the <i>Simplified Chinese</i> character set.

              Cursive styles such as <i>Xíngshū (行書, semi-cursive or running script)</i> and <i>Cǎoshū (草書, cursive or grass script)</i> are less constrained and faster, where more movements made by the writing implement are visible. These styles' stroke orders vary more, sometimes creating radically different forms. They are descended from <i>Lìshū (隸書, Clerical Script)</i>, in the same time as Regular script in <i>Han Dynasty (漢朝, 206 BCE – 220 CE)</i>, but <i>Xíngshū (行書)</i> and <i>Cǎoshū (草書)</i> were used for personal notes only, and were never used as standard. <i>Cǎoshū (草書)</i> style was highly appreciated during the reign of <i>Emperor Wu of Han (漢武帝, 140 BCE − 87 CE)</i>.

              The shape, size, stretch and type of hair in the brush, the color and density of the ink, as well as the absorptive speed and surface texture of the paper are the main physical parameters influencing the final result. The calligrapher also influences the result by the quantity of ink/water he lets the brush take up, then by the pressure, inclination, and direction he gives to the brush, producing thinner or bolder strokes, and smooth or toothed borders. Eventually, the speed, acceleration and deceleration of the writer's moves, turns, and crochets, and the stroke order give the "spirit" to the characters by influencing greatly their final shape.

            <h3 class="section-title__box">Study</h3>
            <p>
              Traditionally, the bulk of the study of calligraphy is composed of copying strictly exemplary works from the apprentice's master or from reputed calligraphers, thus learning them by rote. Competency in a particular style often requires many years of practice. Correct strokes, stroke order, character structure, balance, and rhythm are essential in calligraphy. A student would also develop their skills in traditional Chinese arts, as familiarity and ability in the arts contributes to their calligraphy.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since the development of regular script, nearly all calligraphers have started their study by imitating exemplary models of regular script. A beginning student may practice writing the character <i>永 (yǒng; literally: eternal)</i> for its abundance of different kinds of strokes and difficulty in construction. <i>The Eight Principles of Yong (永字八法)</i> refers to the eight different strokes in the character, which some argue summarizes the different strokes in regular script.

              How the brush is held depends on the calligrapher and which calligraphic genre is practiced. Commonly, the brush is held vertically straight gripped between the thumb and middle finger. The index finger lightly touches the upper part of the shaft of the brush (stabilizing it) while the ring and little fingers tuck under the bottom of the shaft, leaving a space inside the palm. Alternatively, the brush is held in the right hand between the thumb and the index finger, very much like a Western pen. A calligrapher may change his or her grip depending on the style and script.

            The brush pen is a traditional writing instrument in Chinese calligraphy. The body of the brush pen can be made from either bamboo, or other materials such as red sandalwood, glass, ivory, silver, even gold. The head of the brush pen can be made from the animal hair, including the weasel, rabbit, deer, goat, pig, tiger, wolf, etc. There is also a tradition in both China and Japan of making a brush using the hair of a newborn, as a once-in-a-lifetime souvenir for the child. This practice is associated with the legend of an ancient Chinese scholar who scored first in the imperial examinations by using such a personalized brush. Calligraphy brushes are widely considered an extension of the calligrapher's arm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, calligraphy may also be done using a pen.

          <h3 class="section-title__box">Ink</h3>
          <p>
            The ink is made from lampblack (soot) and binders, and comes in inksticks which must be rubbed with water on an <a href="#inkstone">inkstone</a> until the right consistency is achieved. Much cheaper, pre-mixed bottled inks are now available, but these are used primarily for practice as stick inks are considered higher quality and chemical inks are more prone to bleeding over time, making them less suitable for use in hanging scrolls. Learning to rub the ink is an essential part of calligraphy study. Traditionally, Chinese calligraphy is written only in black ink, but modern calligraphers sometimes use other colors. Calligraphy teachers use a bright orange or red ink with which they write practice characters on which students trace, or to correct students' work.

            Some people insist that Chinese calligraphy should use special papers, such as <i>Xuan paper (宣紙)</i>, <i>Maobian paper (毛邊紙)</i>, <i>Lianshi paper</i> etc. Any modern papers can be used for brush writing. Because of the long-term uses, <i>Xuan paper (宣紙)</i> became well-known by most of Chinese calligraphers.

            Made from stone, ceramic, or clay from the banks of <i>the Yellow River</i>, inkstone is used to grind the solid inkstick into liquid ink and to contain the ink once it is liquid. Chinese inkstones are highly prized as art objects and an extensive bibliography is dedicated to their history and appreciation.

            Calligraphic works are usually completed by the calligrapher putting his or her seal at the very end, in red ink. The seal serves the function of a signature.
