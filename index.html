                    Chinese calligraphy is a form of calligraphy widely practiced since <i>Imperial China</i> and revered in the Chinese cultural sphere, which often includes the mainland China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, etc. The calligraphic tradition of East Asia originated and developed from Imperial China. There is a general standardization of the various styles of calligraphy in this tradition. Chinese calligraphy and ink and wash painting are closely related, since they are accomplished using similar tools and techniques. Chinese painting and calligraphy distinguish themselves from other cultural arts because they emphasize motion and are charged with dynamic life. Calligraphy has also led to the development of many forms of art, including seal carving, ornate paperweights, and inkstones.

                            As a discipline calligraphy is, at the basic level, a pursuit focused on writing well. Students aim to obtain the writing characteristics of exemplary pieces of writing. Elementary school students practice calligraphy in this way, as do elders practicing temporary calligraphy, without aspiring to artistic creation.

                            Calligraphy is also considered an art, where works are appreciated more or only for their aesthetic qualities.
