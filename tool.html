                        The brush, ink, paper, and inkstone are essential implements of Chinese calligraphy. They are known together as <i>the Four Treasures of the Study (文房四寶)</i>. In addition to these four tools, a water-dropper, desk pads and paperweights are also used by calligraphers.

                    <h3>Brush Pen</h3>
                        <p>
                            The brush pen is a traditional writing instrument in Chinese calligraphy. The body of the brush pen can be made from either bamboo, or other materials such as red sandalwood, glass, ivory, silver, even gold. The head of the brush pen can be made from the animal hair, including the weasel, rabbit, deer, goat, pig, tiger, wolf, etc. There is also a tradition in both China and Japan of making a brush using the hair of a newborn, as a once-in-a-lifetime souvenir for the child. This practice is associated with the legend of an ancient Chinese scholar who scored first in the imperial examinations by using such a personalized brush. Calligraphy brushes are widely considered an extension of the calligrapher's arm.

                        <p>
                            Today, calligraphy may also be done using a pen.

                    <h3>Ink</h3>
                        <p>
                            The ink is made from lampblack (soot) and binders, and comes in inksticks which must be rubbed with water on an <a href="#inkstone">inkstone</a> until the right consistency is achieved. Much cheaper, pre-mixed bottled inks are now available, but these are used primarily for practice as stick inks are considered higher quality and chemical inks are more prone to bleeding over time, making them less suitable for use in hanging scrolls. Learning to rub the ink is an essential part of calligraphy study. Traditionally, Chinese calligraphy is written only in black ink, but modern calligraphers sometimes use other colors. Calligraphy teachers use a bright orange or red ink with which they write practice characters on which students trace, or to correct students' work.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Paper</h3>
                        <p>
                            Some people insist that Chinese calligraphy should use special papers, such as <i>Xuan paper (宣紙)</i>, <i>Maobian paper (毛邊紙)</i>, <i>Lianshi paper</i> etc. Any modern papers can be used for brush writing. Because of the long-term uses, <i>Xuan paper (宣紙)</i> became well-known by most of Chinese calligraphers.

                        <p>
                            Made from stone, ceramic, or clay from the banks of <i>the Yellow River</i>, inkstone is used to grind the solid inkstick into liquid ink and to contain the ink once it is liquid. Chinese inkstones are highly prized as art objects and an extensive bibliography is dedicated to their history and appreciation.

                    <h3>Seal and seal paste</h3>
                        <p>
                            Calligraphic works are usually completed by the calligrapher putting his or her seal at the very end, in red ink. The seal serves the function of a signature.
